If you want to auto import any private keys in your wallet, create an `accounts.env` file here

Check the main [README](../../README.md)

**NOTE**: Including `.dev-eos-keys` folder in the repository is needed so that `Dockerfile` builds successfully even if you do not create an `.dev-eos-keys/accounts.env` file (i.e if you don't want to make any initial account imports)
